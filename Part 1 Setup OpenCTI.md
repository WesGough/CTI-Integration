# CTI Integration

## Objective

OpenCTI is an open-source platform designed for managing and analyzing Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). Having a centralized location to manage all of your CTI data is a great way to correlate observables that you may come across in your environment such as an IP, domain, or file hash. Part 1 of this series will walk you through how to install OpenCTI on your virtual machine. Two prerequisites are that have two Ubuntu server setup: one for a Splunk server and the other for the OpenCTI server.

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
